## Food Festival

### Description

*Build a web application for an upcoming three-day food event. The current app loads very slowly when the client simulates a 4G internet connection using Chrome DevTools. The client needs a fast and performant application, especially on mobile, because the app is designed for event attendees who will be using it on their phones*
